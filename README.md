# Object Detection in Images using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to perform object detection in an image using Python and the OpenCV library. Specifically, the example focuses on mug detection using the Canny edge detection image processing method.

## Key Features
- **Object Detection**: Using the Canny algorithm to identify object boundaries in an image.
- **Image Processing**: Support for loading, processing, and visualizing images.
- **Result Visualization**: Displaying the original image and the processing results for a clear presentation of the algorithm's work.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main development language.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing images and processing results.

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 and above).
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python matplotlib
    ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook and open the project file.
4. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to perform object detection.

## Use Cases
- Object detection in photos or videos.
- Automating image analysis for industrial or everyday tasks.
- Learning the basics of computer vision.

## Potential Improvements
- Adding support for working with video.
- Integration with machine learning models to improve object detection accuracy.
- Optimizing code for working with large images or data streams.
